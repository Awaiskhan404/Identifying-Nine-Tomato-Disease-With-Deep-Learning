<p>Tomato is an inseparable part of India's diet, that's why in the fiscal year 2020, the volume of tomato production in India amounted to over 21 million metric tons. But this number can be even pushed further if tomato fields are get protected by malicious diseases which results in severe losses for farmers both in terms of money and time.  In order to fight this problem, I have created a deep learning model that is capable of identifying healthy tomatoes plant and 9 most harmful and popular diseases of tomatoes that are bacterial spot, early blight, late blight, leaf mold, septoria leaf spot, spider mites, target spot, yellow leaf curl virus, and tomato mosaic virus.

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>I have created a deep learning model that is efficiently able to identify nine tomato diseases. The model uses conventional layers at the core for feature extraction and use dense layers for the classification task. The model was trained for 10 epochs with batch size 574. The dataset used for model training was downloaded from Kaggle (https://bit.ly/3qOrdX0).</p>
